          I'm a dedicated coding enthusiast with a transformative journey from a
          captivating hobby to a thriving career. My educational path led me
          through The University of New Brunswick's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp,
          where I honed my skills and gained unwavering confidence in my
          abilities. My work is defined by meticulous attention to detail,
          resulting in clean, responsive code. I boast a versatile technical
          toolkit encompassing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, jQuery,
          Bootstrap, Git/Github, Node.JS, Express.JS, SQL, MySQL, Figma, EJS,
          Sequelize, Heroku, NoSQL, and MongoDB. I thrive in problem-solving,
          excel under pressure, and am known for my collaborative spirit.
          Embracing new challenges, be it learning new languages or exploring
          fresh frameworks, is my constant pursuit, fueling my growth and
          passion for this dynamic field.

          Beyond coding, I'm a creative at heart. I immerse myself in 3D art
          using Blender, crafting captivating models and animations. Music is
          another passion, as I enjoy playing and recording, rounding out my
          skill set. The ever-evolving world of technology excites me, and I'm
          committed to leaving my mark in this dynamic field. Thanks for being
          part of this exciting journey!
